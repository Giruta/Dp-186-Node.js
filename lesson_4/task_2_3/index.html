<!-- Task 2. Meeting-->

<!-- John has invited some friends. His list is:-->
<!--
<!-- s = "Fred:Corwill;Wilfred:Corwill;Barney:Tornbull;Betty:Tornbull;Bjon:Tornbull;Raphael:Corwill;Alfred:Corwill";-->
<!--
<!-- Could you make a program that-->
<!-- makes this string uppercase-->
<!-- gives it sorted in alphabetical order by last name.-->
<!--     When the last names are the same, sort them by first name. Last name and first name of a-->
<!-- guest come in the result between parentheses separated by a comma.-->
<!--     So the result of function meeting(s) will be:-->
<!--
<!-- "(CORWILL, ALFRED)(CORWILL, FRED)(CORWILL, RAPHAEL)(CORWILL, WILFRED)(TORNBULL, BARNEY)(TORNBULL, BETTY)(TORNBULL, BJON)"-->
<!--
<!-- It can happen that in two distinct families with the same family name two people have the-->
<!-- same first name too.-->

<!--3. Mission: Hidden Message-->
<!--Story-->
<!--For many years, The Foundation has been encoding their messages in inconspicuous-->
<!--letters. Now, they are looking for a function that will solve the decoding of the messages-->
<!--for them.-->
<!--Rules of decoding-->
<!--You will receive a string containing several sentences (the “letter”).-->
<!--The length of each word of the first sentence signals the word we must take for each of-->
<!--the following sentences. So if the first sentence has two words of 3 and 7 letters in it,-->
<!--we should pick the third word of the second sentence, and the seventh of the third. We-->
<!--would then be done with the first sentence of the hidden message.-->
<!--If there is another sentence in our letter after we are done picking the words signaled-->
<!--by the first sentence, we’ll treat it as we did the first. In our example, if there was a-->
<!--fourth sentence, we would count the lengths of its words as we did with the first, and-->
<!--pick the words in those positions in the following sentences; that would give us the-->
<!--second sentence of the hidden message - and we would go on like that indefinitely.-->
<!--Dots, question and exclamation marks (.?!) are the valid delimiters of the end of a-->
<!--sentence.-->
<!--Punctuation marks (such as those above, commas, quotes, and apostrophes) don’t go-->
<!--into the word count.-->
<!--Punctuation marks, except apostrophes, don’t transfer into the decoded message (so-->
<!--apostrophes do).-->
<!--Words with apostrophes count as one word (I’m would count as a word of two letters).-->
<!--Expected Output-->
<!--Each sentence of the decoded hidden message must have its first word capitalised-->
<!--(the rest should be in lowercase) and end with a dot ..-->
<!--Any sentence after a dot must be preceded by a space.-->
<!--There should be no spaces at the beginning or the end of the decoded message.-->
<!--For an empty string, return a empty string.-->
<!--Example-->
<!--'Yesterday, we bumped into Laura. It had to happen, but you-->
<!--can\'t deny the timing couldn\'t be worse. The "mission" to try-->
<!--and seduce her was a complete failure last month. By the way,-->
<!--she still has the ring I gave her. Anyhow, it hasn\'t been a-->
<!--pleasurable experience to go through it. I wanted to feel done-->
<!--with it first.'-->

<!--Should return:-->
<!--'The mission has been done.'-->
